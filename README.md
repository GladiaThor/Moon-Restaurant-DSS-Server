# Moon-Restaurant-DSS-Server
First term project (Software engineering and management @ the University of Gothenburg)
<br>Written in 2012 by Thor K Salehi <Claxxess> and Emily Kolar Beltran <Emlan>
<br>If configured and compiled correctly the server will connect to an SQL database and await SQL commands from a front end. 
<br>There are some mild security features that somewhat protects your database but since this is the very first comprehensive piece of code I ever wrote I would recommend a proper walkthrough and security check if you wish to use it.
<br> Please feel free to E-Mail me if you wish to use this and run into problem =)
